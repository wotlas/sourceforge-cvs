  4.1 - what does the name wotlas mean ?

  > well, that's easy it's Wheel Of Time - Light And Shadow. The name 'Light And Shadow' was chosen
    after an internal poll among the development team.


  4.2 - what gave you the idea to start this project ?

  > The french 'Wheel Of Time' mailing list has a founder member named Valère which wanted to create
    a new kind of mud/chat for the mailing list members. After some brain storming on the subject a
    development project begun the 5 March 2001. Our goal was at the time to create a new kind of
    online multiplayer game that would offer players enhanced ways to communicate and interact.
    We've not reach our goal yet but we are getting closer each day.
