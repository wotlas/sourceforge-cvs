CHANGES BETWEEN 1.3.1 AND ?
-------------------------

Sleeping Owl - Preparing library separation and vyger

 - 01/22/08 - test/wotlas.suite : adding wotlas.libs.graphics2d.demo module
to test the graphics2d library and dev documents from the wotlas-2D-engine-v1.3.zip 
archive. After building the wotlas.suite, the script launch.bat/launch.sh in
the demo module works and launch the same example as in the archive.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2.2 AND V1.3 (25 May 2002)

 - updated the ImageLibrary to support the use of images from a non-disk source : JAR, Network
 - separated the FontFactory from the ImageLibrary.
 - updated the FontFactory to support the use of images from a non-disk source : JAR, Network
 - added a pop-up menu system : transparent, animated, draggable, allowing high numbers of items.
 - added new brightness filter hability for sprites, enabled the use brightness masks.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2.2 AND V1.2 (6 April 2002)
----------------------------------------------

 - added a new graphics director : EnhancedGraphicsDirector. This new director uses Java 1.4 Volatile Images for double buffering.
 - added a screen==null test in the graphics directors. This is to prevent rendering before the init() method is called.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2 AND V1.1.2 (18 March 2002)
-----------------------------------------------

 - added a FontFactory to manage the fonts usage in the 2D engine. This is a static factory that will become
   more dynamic in a next version. The ImageLibrary uses the userFontPath string (second constructor parameter)
   to create the FontFactory.
 - added support of other image types to our 2D graphics engine (thanks to an idea of D. Moonfire)
 - corrected a bug in TextDrawable due to a behaviour change of Java 1.4 for Rectangle.intersects()
   (thanks to knut).
 - made some exception messages more explicit.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.1.2 AND V1.1.1 (20 January 2002)
---------------------------------------------------
