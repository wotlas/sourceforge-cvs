<p> <font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section we 
  describe some technical aspects of our project. For more details take a look 
  at our <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wotlas" target="_blank">CVS 
  repository</a> ( code comments are in english ).</font></p>
<p><img src="images/button.gif" width="15" height="14" align="absmiddle"> <b>Network 
  Engine. </b><i>( wotlas.libs.net )</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <font size="2">It exchanges messages on top of TCP/IP sockets. The messages 
    are made of two separated parts : data and behaviour. The behaviour is the 
    message's associated code on the remote side. The data part is composed of 
    raw java primitives only. The message sender possesses only the data part 
    of the message, the message receiver posseses the data and behaviour parts. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Main Features : </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">- client - server architecture. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- different network personalities providing asynchronous 
      message handling, packet aggregation, ping information, etc ... </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">- dynamic message class loading. </font></p>

<p><img src="images/button.gif" width="15" height="14" align="absmiddle"> <b>A-star 
  pathfinding algorithm.</b> <i>( wotlas.libs.pathfinding )</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="2">We have an implementation of the A-star algorithm for path-finding. 
    Given a 2 color bitmap mask this algorithm finds the path between two points. 
    The only needed class is <i>wotlas.utils.List</i> which is an adapted implementation 
    of the <i>java.util.Vector</i> class ( adapted for the A-star algorithm for 
    better performance ).We also have developed a simple smoothing algoritm for 
    our Astar.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">There is an example of implementation of this library in our 
    CVS repository : <i> &nbsp;/wotlas/src/test/petrus</i>.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/button.gif" width="15" height="14" align="absmiddle"> <b>Persistence 
  Engine.</b> <i>( wotlas.libs.persistence )</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">Our client accounts and game worlds need to be made persistent. 
    This library allows us to save and restore objects in <i>dot-properties</i> 
    files ( human readable text files ). It is mainly composed of one class, <i>PropertiesConverter, 
    </i>that offers various <i>save</i> and <i>load</i> methods.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">To be saved/loaded, a property should only have a public <i>getter</i> 
    and <i>setter</i> and should not be transient ( i.e. if the field is xxx, 
    setXxx() and getXxx() should be public ).</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> Arrays are supported either with indexed setter/getter or 
    with a global setter/getter (taking an array as an argument), but only one-dimension 
    arrays are supported.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/button.gif" width="15" height="14" align="absmiddle"> <b>Generic 
  2D graphics Engine</b> <i>( wotlas.libs.graphics2D )</i>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></i><font size="2">A<i> 
    </i>flexible 2D Graphics engine you can use in applications that need 2D side-scrolling 
    display. It mainly works around a <i>GraphicsDirector</i> that displays <i>Drawable 
    </i>objects and uses a <i>WindowPolicy</i> to scroll the game screen in an 
    appropriate manner.</font></p>
  <p> <font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawable </i>is the 
    mother class of all the graphical objects. We provide a full set of graphical 
    objects for our<i> </i>2D engine<i> </i>:<i> TextDrawable </i>(for text display 
    with any font you want)<i>, MotionlessSprite </i>(to handle motionless images)<i>, 
    Sprite </i>(to handle images that can have motion), <i>MultiRegionImage</i> 
    (to handle huge images), <i>AuraEffect</i> (to display a selection aura on 
    sprites), and much more... Of course you can develop your own <i>Drawable</i> 
    objects very easily.</font></p>
  <p> <font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>To load/unload 
    images efficiently and reduce memory costs we use an <i>ImageLibrary</i> which 
    is a simple image database. Our <i>ImageLibrary</i> can load images from disk 
    when the application starts and/or just in time when the images are needed. 
    The structure of the library is a tree composed of directories and images. 
    Each directory can contain images and/or sub-directories. You can indicate 
    directories that must have mutually exclusive sub-directories (especially 
    useful for huge images you don't want to be in memory at the same time).</font></p>
  <p> <font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Finally, our 2D 
    graphics engine works with <i>Java</i> <i>Swing</i> as its <i>GraphicsDirector</i> 
    extends the <i>JPanel</i> class. But of course, because <i>Wotlas </i>is a 
    GNU open-source project, you can change that easily.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">You can download our 2D engine ( <b>source + doc + demo</b> 
    ) from our SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wotlas">homepage</a>.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/button.gif" width="15" height="14" align="absmiddle"> <b>World 
  Organization </b> <i>( wotlas.common.universe )</i>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">Our game universe is made of distinct worlds, towns and buildings. 
    Players can only see their character when they wander in buildings, moving 
    from one room to another. To limit the awareness of players in buildings and 
    have a modest scalable system we chose a simple approach : <i>locales</i> 
    with a <i>1-step policy</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2"> Building floors are made of different rooms ( <i>locales 
    ) </i>that are linked by gateways ( open space with or without doors ). Players 
    can only see what's in the current room of their character <i>and </i>what's 
    in the rooms linked to their current room ( <i>1-step policy</i> ). This is 
    a simple way to perform some interest management. For a far more complete 
    approach on the subject refer to the MASSIVE-III and RING virtual environments.</font></p>
