INSTALLATION
------------

1 - For Windows users only: if you had on old version of java
    ( jdk1.2, jre1.2, jdk1.1, jre1.1, ... ) first uninstall it !

2 - download the latest version of java development kit : jdk1.3 (j2se 1.3).
    Wotlas works fine with Java v1.3.0 and Java v1.3.1

3 - For Windows users only: restart your computer after this installation.
    For Unix users : make sure that you run the right version of Java when
    you enter "java" on the command line. You should see a "v1.3" when you
    enter "java -version". Modify your PATH variable if it's not so.

4 - Perform a checkout of our repository on the wotlas-release-1.0 TAG.

5 - Our ugly makefile is in the build directory ( there is a README in the build directory
    that explains how to compile our project with make ).

6 - In the bin directory you'll find .bat commands ans .sh scripts to launch the various wotlas
    utilities :

      - world-generator.bat & world-generator.sh generate the wotlas world's data
        (see wotlas.server.setup.WorldGenerator).

      - server-setup.bat & server-setup.sh start a setup utility for the wotlas server.
        The 0 server ID can be used for localhost. Other positive Ids are supposed to represent
        servers on the Internet. In wotlas v2 servers will be able to exchange client accounts
        as clients travel around the world and enter towns/buildings that are on other servers.

      - server.bat & server.sh starts the selected wotlas server ( see src/config/server.cfg ).

      - client.bat & client.sh start the wotlas client ( the src/config/client-profiles.cfg
        contains information on the client accounts, you can erase this file if you want to
        reset the client's state).
