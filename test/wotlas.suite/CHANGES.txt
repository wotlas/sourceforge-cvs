CHANGES BETWEEN 1.3.1a AND 1.3.1b
-------------------------

08/18/08 - see CHANGES.txt - version 1.3.1b
Sleeping Owl - in test/wotlas.suite directories
 
 A- Adding WotlasGameDefinition in services lookup.
 B- Adding Standalone server and Standalone server and IOChannelFactory;
 C- Generating release files by ant script;
 D- Adding a 'disclaimer.txt'; 

---
A- WotlasGameDefinition in services lookup.
---
All the services in Wotlas are instantiated by the class wotlas.utils.Tools using the netbeans lookup to find the 
implementation needed for the execution of the asked service.
The current modification will allow 
 - to differentiate the implementation needed for the requester;
 - to easy the choice of services depending on the game played; 

Planned changes  :
 01 - wotlas.utils : as we have to instantiate both sides classes, we need a filter to choose wich part we have to
instantiate.
For this purpose all the classes instantiated by the wotlas.utils.Tools.getImplementorsOf(Class) will be filtered by 
a specific class wotlas.utils.WotlasGameDefinition. By doing this, with two different filters instantiated by the
client side and the other server side, we would instantiate the classes needed by each of these.

All the classes instantiated by Tools will extend the WishGameExtension interfaces in order to better recognize them.
The WotlasGameDefinition would be instantiated in the wotlas.client.ClientDirector and wotlas.server.ServerDirector 
at the very start of the application.

---
B- Standalone server and IOChannelFactory
---
The standalone server is a server of a wotlas game that is instantiated in the same Java Runtime Environment that of 
the client side. The first purpose of the standalone server is to allow testing without launching a specific server.
The first limitation is that it can not be connected to an other client outside from the JRE.

In order to develop this functionality, we need first to allow the instantiation of both side of the Wotlas framework.
Then we have to change the behavior associated to the instantiation of the socket input and output.

Planned changes  :
 01 - wotlas.utils : adding WotlasGameDefinition (see above)

 02 - wotlas.libs.net : create an abstraction for the instantiation of wotlas's input and output client and server 
sides.
The wotlas.libs.io.IOChannelFactory would have the charge to create the client and server io channels. Next we have to
move the socket code into the wotlas.libs.net.io.SocketChannelFactory and the different classes associated.
We have to replace all the java.net.Socket and java.net.ServerSocket by their abstraction parts : 
wotlas.libs.net.IOChannel and wotlas.libs.net.IOServerChannel.
As it will be two different wotlas.libs.net.NetMessageFactory in the same JRE : the one for the client side and the 
other for the server, we have to give the reference of it in each specific side.

 03 - wotlas.libs.net : for the standalone server we need a Pipe Input and output channels.
It will be the wotlas.libs.net.io.PipedChannelFactory and the Piped* classes.

 04 - wotlas.libs.net : defining what is a server config to better distinguish what is a standalone server 
 confirguration.

---
C- Generating release files by ant script
---
Planned changes  :
 - Creating two ant script to allow fast creation of the different released files.
The main script 'Build-release.xml' could be used either by ant using 'build-release.bat' or by ant in eclipse 
or netbeans.

build-product.xml = define macro-targets used for compilation and packaging; 
                    define macro-packaging of ressources and projects;
build-release.xml = define the release files targets;



CHANGES BETWEEN 1.3.1 AND 1.3.1a
-------------------------

Sleeping Owl - Preparing library separation and vyger

 - 03/20/08 - test/wotlas.suite : eclipse integration of projects 
(project names in cvs tree)
  1- wotlas in wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/wotlas 
  2- vyger in wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/test/vyger
  3- vyger.test in wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/test/vyger.test
  4- wotlas.test.client in wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/test/wotlas.test.client
  5- wotlas.test.server in wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/test/wotlas.test.server
If you do want to compile all these projects in eclipse 3.3, you need first
to build all these projects and the 'wotlas.suite' in netbeans before launching
eclipse. For now you must use the jars created by netbeans in the dist/lib 
directories. In the future we will either create maven configurations or adding
an http repositories of stable libraries jars.
 To import all these projects in eclipse, you need only to get the project set :
http://wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/wotlas/wotlas/wotlas_EclipseProjectSet.psf

 - 03/20/08 - test/vyger : more merging in the
 wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/test/vyger/first_alpha/merged/
 directory : adding inventory, lieManager; creating EditorManager interface, 
 DiceRollerManager and PrimaryKeyGenerator in order to not having cross reference
 between wotlas.client, wotlas.common and wotlas.server packages; note that all
 the cross references are not resolved.

 - 03/15/08 - test/vyger : cleaning up the sources of vyger in 
wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/test/vyger/first_alpha/cleaned/
and adding a merged sources directory :
wotlas.cvs.sourceforge.net/wotlas/test/vyger/first_alpha/merged/
that contains only the differences with wotlas stable sources.
Note that you can test the vyger project with merged sources only in eclipse.
Netbeans don't allow to have the same sources names in both the jars and the
source directories.

 - 02/25/08 - wotlas.server.AccountManager : Change ERROR message to NOTICE as
long as the inventory is saved empty.
 - 02/25/08 - test/wotlas.suite : change loading of resources using the
classloader (class.getResourceAsStream() or class.getResource()) : In netbeans 
module, classes and resources loading use a specific ClassLoader that prevents
to use a module resource that is not declared in module dependencies.
Actually we are using wotlas.common.ResourceManager to load many resources,
but we want the 'wotlas.common' module to be the most independent possible, 
we need to use the SystemClassLoader to load resources.
Be aware it is a programming trick that would not be kept in the future.

 - 01/22/08 - test/wotlas.suite : adding wotlas.libs.graphics2d.demo module
to test the graphics2d library and dev documents from the wotlas-2D-engine-v1.3.zip 
archive. After building the wotlas.suite, the script launch.bat/launch.sh in
the demo module works and launch the same example as in the archive.

 - 01/11/08 - wotlas : Improvement of ResourceManager and resources jar loading
 - 01/11/08 - wotlas : FIX NullPointerException in InventoryPlugin when it is loaded in
jars;

 - 01/11/08 - test/wotlas.test.client : adding a project using jars build in wotlas.suite
to test the client side;
 - 01/11/08 - test/wotlas.test.server : adding a project using jars build in wotlas.suite
to test the server side using resources loaded in jars;

 - 01/11/08 - test/wotlas.suite : adding common and randland resources;
 - 01/11/08 - test/wotlas.suite : applying the same patches as these of /wotlas project;


 - 12/31/07 - Fix : moving the class 'wotlas.common.objects.inventories.InventoryLayout' and renaming
package wotlas.libs.graphics2d, change the package names in the resources files.
 - 12/31/07 - Fix : loading of messages and chat commands classes in jars server; adding 'classes.lst'
in packages for use in wotlas.utils.Tools.

 - 12/21/07 - Preparing library separation : creating wotlas.suite in test/wotlas.suite
 - 12/21/07 - Preparing vyger : creating vyger project in test/vyger
 - 12/21/07 - Renaming the 'wotlas.libs.graphics2D' in 'wotlas.libs.graphics2d' : the use of capitalized
 letter should be prohibited in package names; You have to rebuild your universe with
 WorldGenerator.
 - 12/21/07 - Moving the class 'wotlas.common.objects.inventories.InventoryLayout' : it uses wotlas 
client references, it should be moved in wotlas.client.screen.plugin.
 - 12/21/07 - Fix wotlas.utils.Tools : using HashSet in order to have once time a class or a resource.
 - 12/21/07 - Fix: font 'dialog' cause NullPointerException in menu 2D

Sleeping Owl - Jdk 1.6 compliant task - more clean up
