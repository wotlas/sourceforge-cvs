CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2.3 AND V1.3 (5 May 2002)
--------------------------------------------

 - Added bots definitions and a link to a remote AliceBot server.
 - Improved the server architecture : lots of tasks done before by the ServerDirector are now
   done by the DataManager & ServerManager.
 - Added a new method for dynamic code loading.
 - all the resource access have been changed : the ResourceManager now handles every type of resource
 - new SoundLibrary architecture around a SoundPlayer & MusicPlayer created dynamically at start-up
 - brightness mask added to maps.
 - Progress Monitor added when you enter the game.
 - Antialiased Swing is now a wotlas library.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2.2 AND V1.2.3 (11 April 2002)
------------------------------------------------

 - Added a Message Router & Factory to make the server & client structure more clear.
   Each location Town / World / Room has a MessageRouter attached to it. The MessageRouter is provided
   by a factory at start-up.
 - Thanks to the new message routing architecture, some old bugs have been fixed, especially those
   annoying null pointer exceptions that appeared in v1.2.2 ...
 - fixed a bug in the server address setup utility ( setup.bat ). The password was not set for file transfer.
 - updated pscp.exe from v0.51 to v0.52 (server side). Thus the -batch option works now...
 - your player's nickname is now displayed again in the "Info" plug-in. The nickname of other players is still
   not displayed.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2.1 AND V1.2.2 (3 April 2002)
------------------------------------------------

 - new map : Emond's Field.
 - all the wotlas resources are now gathered in a same directory ( default is ../base ).
 - the wotlas server, client & server utilities ( register & setup ) are now completely independent
   from the location of the resources. By default they search data in "../base" but this can be changed
   easily by adding a  '-base e:\wotlas\data' on their command lines. We now use a Resource Manager.
 - the wotlas server & client have new command line options.
 - The ClientManager (manages the different client swing windows) now extends the JIntroWizard.
 - The Persistence Managers (used to load/save universe, configs, etc... to/from dot properties file)
   do not exist anymore. Their save/load methods have been moved to other object managers.
 - The ServerConfigList (managed the configs of the servers) has been renamed to ServerConfigManager
   and possesses now all its asociated save/load/create methods.
 - The World Managers (manages the world data) found in wotlas.client and wotlas.server do not
   exist anymore. Their code has been transfered to the standard wotlas.common.WorldManager.
 - The wotlas.client.ClientManager, wotlas.client.DataManager (manages the client data and processes)
   are not singletons anymore.
 - The chat commands are now loaded dynamically on the server side.
 - Client Plug-Ins ! the JPlayerPanel ( class that previously held the tab panels Info, Away & Lie )
   now dynamically loads the classes found in the wotlas.client.screen.plugin package
   AND that are instances of the JPanelPlugIn class.
 - The smiley system has been made more severe.
 - New sounds when you enter *doh* or *toh* in the chat
 - Added 10 new smileys.
 - Added hardware acceleration for the 2D game screen. The new graphics director ( EnhancedGraphicsDirector )
   uses Java 1.4 Volatile images. The option is available in the Options Panel only if the Java version is
   equal or higher than 1.4.0.
 - Added new Wotlas-FAQ entries on PPPoE, flickering, and pscp's first use (thanks to Bibi).
 - Added a shutdown Hook on the server side, so that the wotlas server can now be shut down safely
   by CTRL+C or any system signal (SIGTERM, SIGKILL).
 - Added a new chat button to insert images in the chat via the IMG HTML tag.
 - Added automatic info to Away messages : last connection date.
 - Corrected bugs in the chat player name list. The off line players are now displayed in gray.
 - Added player name completion. Just enter the first letter of a name and hit TAB, one or more times.
 - Added a HTML Macro plug-in (thanks to fred for the idea). Macros can be used in the chat, Away Plug-in.
 - Added pure rotation movements to enable players to turn on themselves. You have to maintain the left mouse
   button pressed and move the cursor to the left or right...
 - Added "Iconified" state detection for game window. This way we reduce the tick rate and so reduce the CPU use.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2 AND V1.2.1 (19 March 2002)
-----------------------------------------------

 - Corrected a bug found by valere & petrus on the "/who" command.


CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2 AND V1.1.2 (18 March 2002)
-----------------------------------------------

 - added new maps : "Shayol Ghul" (2 maps), "White Tower" (4 maps), the Ways (1 map), "South Tv Ruins"
   is now "Braem Wood" and "White Tower - Front" (1 map).
 - added multi-server support. A player account can now travel from one server to another.
   The game universe can now be shared between servers. Each server possesses a set of buildings.
 - added new characters to the game : Younglings, Warders, Tower Guard, Shaitan, Keeper of chronicles,
   Children of the Light, Wolf Brother, Asha'man, M'Hael,Aiel Warrior.
 - added ServerConfigList buffer flush every six hour (to force update of the server table)
   The server's IP/DNS name is now stored in a separate file server-X.cfg.adr that has a short buffer life
   (twenty minutes) also our system is now on a "fail-first" mode. We don't check for a new server address
   unless we fail to connect to it.
 - added server-map-setup tool (see .bat .sh commands) to manage server/building asssociation.
   we also reformed the 'server-setup' to make the transfer of the server address easier,
   a new command 'register-setup' is now used for step by step server registration.
 - reformed the chat command system : it now has generic interfaces, processor pattern and online doc.
 - added new chat commands : /server to get info on your current server, /help to get the list of
   available commands, /info to get information on a command, /log to print something in the server log.
 - added "sound" chat commands : /fanfare to play the fanfare, /bell to ring a bell,
   /knock to knock on a door... you have to wait 10 seconds between two sounds (error msg otherwise)
 - added different fanfare sounds for each character class (thanks to an idea of xeno yar litharr)
 - about 8 new musics for all the levels...
 - local password storage. Your passwords are now saved on disk. This option can be unset (configuration panel).
 - corrected bugs in ServerConfigList : the previous code was sometimes attempting to reach a wrong URI.
 - behaviour part of some messages are now in the "invokeLater" mode to avoid events error.
   we made extensive use of the SwingUtilities.invokeLater() utility.
 - reformed and improved the wotlas.libs.net library : it no longuer uses a static registry.
   Our network library is now easier to use : you write a message and its associated behaviour and that's all.
 - The JCroppedWindow code has been improved : it now uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() and doesn't crash
   anymore. Also it now uses a MouseMotionListener for better movement management.
   The About window now uses JCroppedWindow. The JLogWindow has a new image & dark menu bar support.
 - Music management improved : the current music is not stopped if the new level one's is the same.
 - chat display enhanced : we now use our own version of the HTMLEditorKit.
 - persistence manager behaviour changed : we no longer save universe data during daily persistence save.
 - Our wizard classes for wotlas setup have now been gathered into a library. The new approach uses a factory
   to build steps from a class of parameters. These parameters can be saved to a configuration file or sent
   on a stream. 8 generic steps are available.
 - added messages history to the chat. The last 16 chat messages are saved and you can naviguate within the
   list with the up & down arrows.
 - added wotlas central web server up/down detection to the Wotlas Client start-up.
 - added support for direct building to building travel (without returning to the town map).
 - added chat command to ring a server administrator (private chat command).

   a player re-connection or player switching.
 - added 2D graphic effect to see who is speaking (thanks to an idea of knut hamson).
 - added FontFactory to manage the use of the Lucida Blackletter we use in the game.
 - improved replicated player movements : we don't use the movement timestamp if the delta time is less than 500ms.
 - added Lie Manager : you can now lie on your name by creating up to 5 fake names.
 - added support of other image types to our 2D graphics engine (thanks to an idea of D. Moonfire)
 - new format for the /who command : it now displays the players location (town or world only).
 - the wotlas network manager code and scripts have been integrated to the wotlas code tree.
 - corrected bug in TextDrawable due to a behaviour change of Java 1.4 for Rectangle.intersects()
