CHANGES BETWEEN V1.2 AND V1.1.2 (18 March 2002)
-----------------------------------------------

 - added new maps : "Shayol Ghul" (2 maps), "White Tower" (4 maps), the Ways (1 map), "South Tv Ruins"
   is now "Braem Wood" and "White Tower - Front" (1 map).
 - added multi-server support. A player account can now travel from one server to another.
   The game universe can now be shared between servers. Each server possesses a set of buildings.
 - added new characters to the game : Younglings, Warders, Tower Guard, Shaitan, Keeper of chronicles,
   Children of the Light, Wolf Brother, Asha'man, M'Hael,Aiel Warrior.
 - added ServerConfigList buffer flush every six hour (to force update of the server table)
   The server's IP/DNS name is now stored in a separate file server-X.cfg.adr that has a short buffer life
   (twenty minutes) also our system is now on a "fail-first" mode. We don't check for a new server address
   unless we fail to connect to it.
 - added server-map-setup tool (see .bat .sh commands) to manage server/building asssociation.
   we also reformed the 'server-setup' to make the transfer of the server address easier,
   a new command 'register-setup' is now used for step by step server registration.
 - reformed the chat command system : it now has generic interfaces, processor pattern and online doc.
 - added new chat commands : /server to get info on your current server, /help to get the list of
   available commands, /info to get information on a command, /log to print something in the server log.
 - added "sound" chat commands : /fanfare to play the fanfare, /bell to ring a bell,
   /knock to knock on a door... you have to wait 10 seconds between two sounds (error msg otherwise)
 - added different fanfare sounds for each character class (thanks to an idea of xeno yar litharr)
 - about 8 new musics for all the levels...
 - local password storage. Your passwords are now saved on disk. This option can be unset (configuration panel).
 - corrected bugs in ServerConfigList : the previous code was sometimes attempting to reach a wrong URI.
 - behaviour part of some messages are now in the "invokeLater" mode to avoid events error.
   we made extensive use of the SwingUtilities.invokeLater() utility.
 - reformed and improved the wotlas.libs.net library : it no longuer uses a static registry.
   Our network library is now easier to use : you write a message and its associated behaviour and that's all.
 - The JCroppedWindow code has been improved : it now uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() and doesn't crash
   anymore. Also it now uses a MouseMotionListener for better movement management.
   The About window now uses JCroppedWindow. The JLogWindow has a new image & dark menu bar support.
 - Music management improved : the current music is not stopped if the new level one's is the same.
 - chat display enhanced : we now use our own version of the HTMLEditorKit.
 - persistence manager behaviour changed : we no longer save universe data during daily persistence save.
 - Our wizard classes for wotlas setup have now been gathered into a library. The new approach uses a factory
   to build steps from a class of parameters. These parameters can be saved to a configuration file or sent
   on a stream. 8 generic steps are available.
 - added messages history to the chat. The last 16 chat messages are saved and you can naviguate within the
   list with the up & down arrows.
 - added wotlas central web server up/down detection to the Wotlas Client start-up.
 - added support for direct building to building travel (without returning to the town map).
 - added chat command to ring a server administrator (private chat command).
 - added pause/resume feature to the tick thread (client side). It corrected bugs that could happen during
   a player re-connection or player switching.
 - added 2D graphic effect to see who is speaking (thanks to an idea of knut hamson).
 - added FontFactory to manage the use of the Lucida Blackletter we use in the game.
 - improved replicated player movements : we don't use the movement timestamp if the delta time is less than 500ms.
 - added Lie Manager : you can now lie on your name by creating up to 5 fake names.
 - added support of other image types to our 2D graphics engine (thanks to an idea of D. Moonfire)
 - new format for the /who command : it now displays the players location (town or world only).
 - the wotlas network manager code and scripts have been integrated to the wotlas code tree.
 - corrected bug in TextDrawable due to a behaviour change of Java 1.4 for Rectangle.intersects()
