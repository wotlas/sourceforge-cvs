    <p>There are three kind of maps in wotlas :</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><img src="file:../docs/help/images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >World 
        maps. Your player is seen as a <font color="#FF0000">red</font> dot, places 
        and towns where you can go are displayed in <font color="#0033CC">blue</font>. 
        The movements on world maps are very slow <b>but </b>if you start a long 
        trip and quit the game, your character will be <b>still</b> travelling 
        on the server. So if you re-connect later you'll find that your character 
        has reached his/her destination...</p>
      <p>Note also that you can not see other players on world maps but you can 
        still chat with them (this behaviour may disappear in a next version of 
        wotlas).</p>
      <p><img src="file:../docs/help/images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >Town 
        maps. Your player is seen as a <font color="#FF0000">red</font> dot, places 
        and buildings where you can go are displayed in <font color="#0033CC">blue</font>. 
        Movements on town maps are <b>not </b>saved when you quit the game : you 
        re-start at your latest position.</p>
      <p>Note also that you can not see other players on town maps but you can 
        still chat with them.</p>
      <p>To quit a town map follow the roads !</p>
      <p><img src="file:../docs/help/images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >Building 
        maps. It's the only maps where you can see other players. Just click on 
        the screen to move your player to the place you want. These maps can be 
        huge, so they are usually divided into rooms. You only see players that 
        are in the same room as you or in a near room. The name of the current 
        room is displayed in the upper-right of the game window. As you may have 
        noticed you can only speak to players that are in the same <b>room</b> 
        as you. Of course, if you shout, players that are in near rooms will hear.</p>

    <p><font size="4"><b>Players<a name="players"></a></b></font></p>
    <p>You can see your player and other players on building maps. To get some 
      information on a player click on him/her, it will display :</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><img src="file:../docs/help/images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >his 
        / her full name on the screen and other information in the <i>Information 
        Panel </i>on the right of the screen. You'll also see the last time you 
        eventually met him / her.</p>
      <p><img src="file:../docs/help/images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >his 
        / her aura. The aura reflects the community/rank of a character.</p>
      <p><img src="file:../docs/help/images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >if 
        he / she is offline, an eventual <i>'Away'</i> message... It's a message 
        each player can set in the <i>Away</i> panel to tell something to other 
        players when offline.</p>
