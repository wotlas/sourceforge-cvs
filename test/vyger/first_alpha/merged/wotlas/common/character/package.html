<HTML><BODY>

Classes that describe a Wotlas Character : Aes Sedai, Forsaken, etc...
   or used in d&d like implementation mode.

Now adding attributes, skills, knowlegde, and so on to classes

I'll need to add all this data (skill and so on) and make
'em work with wotlaschar AND rougelikechar, so a new
interface will be added to make 'em all working together
