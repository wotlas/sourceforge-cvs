  <p>Well, that's simple... On the main Wotlas screen you'll find the list of 
    your accounts. Just select one of them and click <i>Load</i>.</p>
  <p>You'll then be asked to enter your password and if it succeeds your game 
    data will be loaded.</p>
  <p>If the server connection fails it probably means that the server is not running. 
    You should :</p>

    to connect later.</p>
  <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >take 
    a look at the <a href="http://wotlas.sf.net/game/news.html">News</a> window 
    that is displayed when you start the game. There might be some information 
    about your wotlas server. </p>

    you still can't connect to your server, contact us on our sourceforge site
