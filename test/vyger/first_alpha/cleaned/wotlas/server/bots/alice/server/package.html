This package defines the implementation of the wotlas AliceChatlistener that is loaded by the AliceServer at runtime. Our AliceChatlistener is named AliceWOTLAS (wotlas is for the protocol here, just like AliceIRC, AliceICQ, etc... ) and uses a server (AliceWotlasServer) to receive message requests from wotlas servers.
