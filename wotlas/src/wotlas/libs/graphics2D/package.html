A flexible 2D Graphics Engine that can be used for side-scrolling games or other 2D games. <br>
<p>
It works with a GraphicsDirector that handle <i>Drawables</i> and uses a WindowPolicy to scroll the game screen in an appropriate manner. Drawables is the mother class of Sprites and other graphical objects. To handle/load images efficiently we use an <i>ImageLibrary</i> which is simple image database. An ImageLibrary can load images from disk when the application starts and/or when the images are needed. You can also specify with options which images are mutually exclusive.
</p><p>
Finally this graphics engine works with Swing as it prints graphics on a JPanel. But of course you can change that easily. The only needed class, to compile and use the wotlas.libs.graphics2D packages, is <i>wotlas.utils.Debug</i>.
</p>
<p>There is an example/demo of implementation of this library in our CVS repository : <i> &nbsp;/wotlas/src/test/graphics/ants</i>. It's a very simple ant simulation. You can also download it from our SourceForge homepage: wotlas.sf.net or sf.net/projects/wotlas </p>
