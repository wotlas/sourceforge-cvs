        Wheel of Time is a famous book series made by Robert Jordan. The books 
        have been translated into multiple languages and tops the NY Times bestseller 
        lists on each release. You'll find lots of <i>Wheel Of Time </i>websites, 
        communities, mailing-lists all around the Internet.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        us everything begun in march 2001 when a founder member of the french 
        <i>Wheel Of Time</i> community asked if we could create an interactive 
        chat for the mailing-list members. After a state of the art on the subject, 
        some brain storming and some development plans the <b>W</b>heel <b>O</b>f 
        <b>T</b>ime <b>L</b>ight-<b>A</b>nd-<b>S</b>hadow project was born. Our 
        ambition at the time was to create a new kind of online multiplayer game 
        that would offer players enhanced ways to communicate and interact. Since 
        then the project has evolved to an international project with members 
        from France, USA, Germany and England. We released <i>wotlas v1.0</i> 
        on october 2001 and have since improved the robustness, quality and richness 
        of our product.<br>

        document will present you the different entities of the wotlas architecture 
        as described on the figure below. We will then end this overview by a 
        short summary of the features you'll find in wotlas v1.2 and those you 
        can expect in future releases.</font></p>

        begin with the client side. To use wotlas, players just need to download 
        a package named <i>Wotlas Client.</i> This package contains the <i>wotlas</i> 
        program and all its associated data ( images, musics, game universe ). 
        To be able to enter the wotlas universe players need to create a game 
        account on one of the available servers. During this step they will define 
        their avatar's characteristics, choose a community (Aes Sedai, WolfBrother, 
        Chidren of the Light, etc... ), and define some visual attributes.</font></p>
      <table width="615" border="0">
        <tr> 
          <td width="253" height="320"><font size="2"><img src="images/chat-group.jpg" width="250" height="300"></font></td>
          <td width="352" height="320"> 
            <p align="left"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
              shown on the figure on the left, everything in the game is seen 
              from a top 2D view. Once you arrive in the <i>Wheel of Time</i> 
              world you'll be able to travel from town to town, visit buildings, 
              wander in streets, explore cellars, etc. You'll be able to meet 
              other players and chat, interact with them.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Because we wanted a very scalable system we limited each player's 
              awareness. The game maps are divided into small areas (<i>locales</i>, 
              just like in RING, MASSIVE systems) linked by gateways (open space 
              with or without doors) and we use them to perform intelligent and 
              efficient message routing. </font><font size="2">So you'll only 
              see players that are in your area or in immediately near areas. 
              This is a simple way to perform some interest management.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Also, to reduce the necessary bandwidth for each player, our movement 
              system is trajectory-based. You just have to click on the screen 
              and your player automatically moves towards your destination, avoiding 
              obstacles. For that we use an A* algorithm with a smoothing add-on. 
              Trajectories are rebuilt on remote clients with the consideration 
              of the Internet lag. Servers also keep their data up-to-date by 
              storing the player's current movement, but they never build trajectories 
              themselves.</font></p>

        This brings us to the server side. The list of the available servers can 
        be found on our <i>SourceForge.net</i> website. This way our client program 
        has an easy way to retrieve it. As it was said before our servers perform 
        message routing, control player actions and manage player accounts. Their 
        data is also made persistent by being saved to disk on creation and every 
        24 hours.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wotlas 
        servers can work stand-alone or can team together in a peer-to-peer way 
        to share the different parts of a same game universe. In that case if 
        you travel to a new map, owned by another server, your account will be 
        transfered to this server and your network connection changed accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally 
        we recently added bots ( understand ro-<i>bots</i> ) to our wotlas servers. 
        Our <i>bots</i> don't really move for the moment ( they only turn to face 
        you ), on the other hand they can chat with you for hours. To make this 
        possible we use a chat robot service on a separate server. We chose <i>Richard 
        Wallace's</i> <i><a href="http://www.alicebot.org" target="_blank">AliceBot</a></i> 
        which is today one of the most promising artificial intelligence system... 
        We are currently working on specialized brains of our bots to make them 
        match some <i>Wheel Of Time</i> character behaviours.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4">T</font>hanks 
        to the support we received from wotlas users and from the developers that 
        joined our team we'll be able to continue this project. Here are some 
        of the features we are working on : Objects, One Power effects, a knowledge 
        system, books you'll be able to write/read, libraries, some role playing 
        features, money, in-game post office, more maps, more graphical effects, 
        more characters, etc... and that's only a beginning... we have a huge 
        <i>ToDo</i> list...</font></p>
