<p>Wotlas Network Engine (see package description).</p>
<p> It exchanges messages on top of TCP/IP sockets. The messages are made of two 
  separated parts : data and behaviour. The behaviour is the message's associated 
  code. The data part is composed of raw java primitives only (plus string facility). 
  The message sender possesses only the data part of the message, the message 
  receiver posseses the data and behaviour parts. </p>
<p> Main Features :
<p>- client - server architecture
<p>- different network personalities providing asynchronous message handling, packet aggregation, etc ...
<p>- dynamic message class loading.
<p>- independent from wotlas in its structure. The only other needed class is wotlas.utils.Debug.
