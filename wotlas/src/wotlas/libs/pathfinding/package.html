An implementation of the A-star algorithm for path-finding. Given a 2 color bitmap mask this algorithm finds the path between two points.<br>

The only needed class is <i>wotlas.utils.List</i> which is an adapted implementation of the <i>java.util.Vector</i> class ( adapted for the A-star algorithm for better performance ).</p><br>

<p>There is an example of implementation of this library in our CVS repository : <i> &nbsp;/wotlas/src/test/petrus</i>.</p>
