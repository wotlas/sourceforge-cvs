A simple Log library that helps saving error messages to a file. Rather than printing error messages you can use the ServerLogStream or JLogStream println() methods to print error messages. The JLogStream class uses the JCroppedWindow class (found in the wotlas.client.gui package) to display the error messages in a Swing window (and also save them every 3minutes to disk). The ServerLogStream displays the error messages on screen ( via System.out ) and also save them to disk every 2 minutes.
