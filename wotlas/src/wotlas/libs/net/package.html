A complete and flexible Network Engine.
<p>
In its form it is independent from wotlas and could be used for many other project types. The only other class needed is wotlas.utils.Debug.
<p>
This network engine is message based (see our tutorial) but does not use java serialization. It provides advanced features like automatic packet processing, dynamic class loading and packet aggregation.
