    How do I create a new account ?</p>
  <p>When you start the game, the first window displayed is the <i>New Account 
    Window. </i>Just enter a login, enter twice a password ( min 5 characters 
    ) and select a game server.</p>
  <p>When you click on a game server a pop-up window appears and shows some information 
    on the selected server.</p>
  <p>When you click on the <b>Ok</b> button a connection with the selected server 
    will established. If an error occur at this step it might either mean that 
    :</p>
  <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >the 
    server is not running. try to select another server ( if there is one ).</p>
  <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >your 
    Internet connection might not be running anymore... ( easy to check... )</p>
  <p>If the connection succeeds you'll have to fill different forms. Take some 
    time to create a realistic Wheel of Time character.</p>
  <p>When your account has been created you are given a key and can directly enter 
    the game.</p>
