  <p>There are three kind of maps in wotlas :</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="../../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >World maps. 
      Your player is seen as a <font color="#FF0000">red</font> dot, places and 
      towns where you can go are displayed in <font color="#0033CC">blue</font>. 
      The movements on world maps are very slow <b>but </b>if you start a travel, 
      quit the game, you are <b>still</b> travelling on the server. So if you 
      re-connect later you'll find that your character has reached his/her destination...</p>
    <p>Note also that you can not see other players on world maps but you can 
      still chat with them.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >Town 
      maps. Your player is seen as a <font color="#FF0000">red</font> dot, places 
      and buildings where you can go are displayed in <font color="#0033CC">blue</font>. 
      The movements on town maps are <b>not </b>saved when you quit the game : 
      you re-start at your latest position.</p>
    <p>Note also that you can not see other players on town maps but you can still 
      chat with them.</p>
    <p>To quit a town map follow the roads !</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >Building 
      maps. It's the only maps where you can see your player. Just click on the 
      screen to move him/her to the place you want.</p>
