  <font size="4" color="#006699">I - FAQ - Wotlas Server</font><font size="4"><br>
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><font size="3">1.0</font></b><font size="3"> - What do I need to do to 
    host a server ?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You need to have a computer with a DSL Internet connection 
      or better. That's all for the hardware. If your computer has its own domain 
      name it will make things easier for you, but you can still live without 
      it ( depends on your Internet provider ). The most important thing to know 
      is that your computer will have to run 24 hours per day and 7days per week. 
      Of course you are still free to stop your server now and then or stop hosting 
      it for ever. We are not a dictatorship !</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.1</b> - Why do I need to register my server ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">To enable other users to find it and connect to it ! This 
      way your server will be listed in our public server table. Of course you 
      can also create you own wotlas network with your own list of servers. To 
      do that download the <i>wotlas manager</i> package and follow the instructions 
      ( note it's experimental ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.2</b> - What is the <i>setup</i> utility for ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The <i>setup</i> utility is used to publish your server's 
      IP/DNS address on our wotlas web server. When you used the <i>register</i> 
      utility you declared and exported a server config that does <i>not</i> contain 
      your IP/DNS address. Why ? because your server's IP address can change very 
      often (if you don't have a domain name) and the <i>register</i> utility 
      is only there to declare static data. Each time your server's IP change 
      you'll have to use the <i>setup</i> utility.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.3</b> - My server has a fixed domain name, can I enter it in the setup 
    utility instead of the IP address ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2"> Yes. If your server has its own domain name, just call 
      the <i>setup</i> utility once, enter your DNS name, export it and quit. 
      You can now start your server and don't need to bother again about setup... 
      unless your computer's IP changes often. You can find free domain name offers 
      on the Internet but you should avoid them. To learn why, read the answer 
      to question 1.16 .</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.4</b> - My server has no domain name and its IP is often changed by 
    my Internet provider. What can I do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well there are no miracles. Each time your server's IP changes 
      you'll have to stop your wotlas server, use the <i>setup</i> utility to 
      update your server's IP and re-start your wotlas server. It's a matter of 
      tempo. If you know your Internet provider's habits it can help you <i>a 
      lot</i>. For example, DSL providers often reset your connection after 24 
      hours of use and change your IP every 1-4 days. Knowing that you can start 
      your Internet connection at a period of the day where you know you'll be 
      at home. This way you'll be there each time to check if the IP has changed.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.5</b> - How do I get my server's IP ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">On Windows systems just open a MS-DOS window or command-line 
      window and enter <i>ipconfig</i>. It'll display all your IP interfaces. 
      On unix systems enter <i>ifconfig</i> to obtain the same result.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.6</b> - I have a DSL Internet connection that works with a DSL hub which 
    is connected to my server via an ethernet network. How can I make my server 
    be enabled from the Internet ?</p>
  <p><b>1.7</b> - How can I move my wotlas server to another computer ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The easiest way is to move the entire <i>wotlas server</i> 
      package to the other computer, re-start the <i>setup</i> utility and of 
      course <i>re-start</i> the server. If for some reason you can't tranfer 
      the entire package just move the following directories : <i>base/home/</i> 
      , <i>base/servers/ </i>, <i>base/universe </i>,<i> src/config.</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.8</b> - I have a firewall on my computer what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll have to configure it to make it accept : incoming 
      connections on <i>java </i>( if you want to be precise just open the ports 
      you declared in the <i>register</i> utility ), outgoing connections on <i>java 
      </i> ( your server will probably use HTTP, your server's ports and the gateway 
      ports of other servers, so the easiest solution is to let any outgoing ports 
      available for java ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.9</b> - How do I shutdown my server ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Press Enter. It will take 30s to shutdown. If nobody connected 
      to the server since the last maintenance save then you can stop it with 
      a CTRL+C. If you are not sure press ENTER.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.10</b> - I can't host my wotlas server anymore, how do I un-register 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Just mail your wotlas network administrator. Attach to your 
      mail the following zipped directories of your server package : <i>base/home</i> 
      , <i>src/config</i>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.11</b> - Someone mailed me to ask for a key to create a <i>special character</i> 
    ? what's this all about ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Special characters are characters that can only appear once 
      in the game. Players have to mail you to ask for the ones that are not already 
      taken. You should keep a list of the already taken special characters. The 
      keys to enable a special character are listed in the <i>src/config/server.cfg</i> 
      . Note that these keys change each time you start your server and are changed 
      by the server every 24 hours. Therefore when you mail a key to a player, 
      the player doesn't have a lot of time to use it. Your keys should be kept 
      secret. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.12</b> - I want to delete someone's account. How can I do that ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll need to know the primary key ( <i>aldiss-1-1</i> 
      for example ) of the account you want to delete. Once you have it you'll 
      have to stop your server ( press Enter ), delete the directory in <i>base/home/</i> 
      which name is the primary key and re-start your server.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.13</b> - I'm using ports above 1024 for my wotlas server and it seems 
    nobody can connect to my server ! what's happening ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well we have no explanation but we witnessed this problem 
      on some Windows OS. This is why we often use the reserved ports : 770, 771, 
      772. These ports are <i>quite</i> never used on the Internet.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.14</b> - Do I need to warn the wotlas network administrator if I have 
    to stop my server for some time ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">If you have to stop your server for less than 12 hours there 
      should be no need to ring the wotlas network administrator. If you have 
      to stop your server for more than 12 hours mail the administrator, he will 
      update the wotlas news to warn users.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.15</b> - Are there any start-up options I can use for my server ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Edit your <i>server.bat</i> or <i>server.sh</i> script. 
      At the end of the <i>ServerDirector</i> line you can add : a <i>-debug </i>if 
      you want more debug information, a <i>-erroronly</i> if you only want errors 
      to be displayed and not <i>NOTICE</i>,<i> WARNING</i> messages.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.16</b> - I've found a free domain name offer on the Internet, do you 
    advice me to use it for wotlas ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, it depends on the offer's content... know that a domain 
      name will be useful to you <i>ONLY </i> if it offers you to have a static 
      ( or quite never changing ) IP address. Well, all the offers of this kind 
      we've met so far are not free... (see your Internet Provider offers). So 
      what can you do ? well, you can still use a free domain name for your wotlas 
      server BUT you have to know the side effects. Let's take the example of 
      <i>www.dyndns.org</i> that proposes you a free <i>xxx.dyndns.org</i> domain 
      name :</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">1 - The offer consists in the association DNS entry / 
        your IP address. Therefore if your IP changes you'll have to use the <i>Dyndns</i> 
        web interface to update your IP in the dyndns DNS tables.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">2 - Of course <i>Dyndns</i> proposes client programs that 
        will detect when your IP changed and will automatically update the <i>Dyndns</i> 
        tables. But even if you can get these client programs to work, there will 
        remain a <i>huge trouble : </i>Internet uses <i>a lot</i> of DNS buffers, 
        proxies and it will take <i>around 4 hours</i> for your new IP to be spread 
        among them. So each time your IP changes your wotlas server will be unreachable 
        for about 4 hours...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">So, unless you have a domain name with its own static IP, 
      we strongly advice you to enter your IP address in the wotlas <i>setup</i> 
      utility each time you have to. It will make your server immediately available 
      to users.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>2.0</b> - When I start wotlas, nothing happens, no windows appear. What's 
    going on ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Oups... If you have installed Java 1.3 or 1.4 this situation 
      should not happen... Please contact us. We also witnessed a situation where 
      wotlas makes Windows crash (?). Thank god it's very rare because we have 
      no explanation... If only we could get some error messages... we tried to 
      use tools like <i>Rational</i>'s <i>Purify</i> ( thanks for the demo !), 
      but we failed to reproduce the bug...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.1</b>- When I start wotlas, the log window appears and then nothing 
    happens. What's going on ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">It probably means that the wotlas web server is unreachable. 
      Look at what is displayed in the log window, there should be a message saying 
      <i>&quot;Wotlas Web Server Unreachable. Trying again... (1/12)&quot; . </i> 
      So wait until these tries end and you should get a message explaining the 
      situation. The message is the following : <i>&quot;We failed to contact 
      the wotlas web server. So we could not update our servers addresses. If 
      this is not the first time you start wotlas on <br>
      your computer, you can try to connect with the previous server config files. 
      Otherwise please restart wotlas later.&quot;. </i>You will get this message 
      if :</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">(1) the wotlas web server is not working. Because our 
        default web server is <i>SourceForge.net</i> this situation is unlikely 
        to happen every day...<br>
        (2) you are trying to use wotlas from your work office. There is 99% chance 
        that your company uses a firewall or a proxy and wotlas doesn't like it 
        very much... ( prefer wotlas at home... ).<br>
        (3) a strange error occured... in this case contact us ! ( take a look 
        at question 2.6 to know what to do ).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.2</b> - I have a firewall on my computer, what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll have to configure it to make it accept outgoing connections 
      on <i> java</i> ( your <i>wotlas-client</i> will probably use HTTP and various 
      server ports... so the easiest solution is to let any outgoing ports available 
      for java ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.3</b> - I'm trying to start wotlas from my work office and it doesn't 
    work. What's going on ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Read the answer to question 2.1 . There is 99% chance that 
      your company uses a firewall or a proxy and wotlas doesn't like it very 
      much... ( prefer wotlas at home... ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.4</b> - How do I know if my Internet connection uses a proxy ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">C</font><font size="2">heck you Internet browser's parameters. 
      For example, on Windows if you have Internet Explorer ( personal note : 
      have you tried www.opera.com ? ) find the <i>Internet Options</i> in the 
      menu and take a look at the <i>Connections</i> tab. If your HTTP port is 
      not 80 it means there is a proxy somewhere.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.5</b> - When I start wotlas I have a window telling me to choose a server 
    to create an account, but the server's list is empty ! What happened ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Are you sure you didn't get a warning message when you started 
      wotlas ? no ? well, if there wasn't any you can still read the answer to 
      question 2.1, there is 99% chance it'll explain your situation... but if 
      there is an error message somewhere in a command window please contact us, 
      you've probably found a new bug...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.6</b> - The game crashed after the final step of the account creation. 
    What happened ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, this is just after this final step, when you enter 
      the game, that some conflicts can happen. Here are the conflicts we know 
      about :</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">- Divx3.1 software. Please un-install it and install Divx4.0 
        (or more).<br>
        - Midi musics. If you're not lucky your sound card drivers might conflict 
        with the javax.sound API. On the main wotlas screen, hit the <i>Options</i> 
        button and turn off the music ( set the music volume to 0 ).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">If this didn't help to solve your problem please read the 
      answer to question 2.7 below.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.7</b> - My problem is not listed here <i>or</i> Wotlas has crashed... 
    what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">If the questions listed here didn't help to solve your problem 
      please contact us. You'll find all the needed URL in the <i>wotlas.html</i>

    <p><font size="2">In the case of a technical problem, you'll have to (1) describe 
      where and when your problem occured, (2) tell us about any error messages 
      that might have been displayed in the command line window, (3) give us the 
      content of your log file : <i>log/wotlas-client.log</i> .</font></p>

  <p><b>2.8</b> - Are there any start-up options I can use for my wotlas client 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Edit your <i>client.bat</i> or <i>client.sh</i> script. 
      At the end of the <i>ClientDirector</i> line you can add : a <i>-debug </i>if 
      you want more debug information (beware it will really display a LOT of 
      debug messages), <i>-classic </i> if you want the classic gray log window 
      image instead of the brown one.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>3.0 -</b> I'm searching for some help on how to play wotlas, where can 
    I find it ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, you'll find some help here but you will also get some 
      in the game : just hit the <i>Help</i> button ! The in-game help has some 
      sections explaining how the chat works, how the movement system works, etc... 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.1</b> - Can I create more than one game account ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, of course ! There is no particular limit. Don't forget 
      to delete old characters you don't want to use anymore.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.2</b> - Ok I'm in the game. What can I do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Wotlas is a virtual community so the main things you'll 
      do here are : travel, chat with other players, build plots, travel, make 
      up stories, search for darkfriends, chat, preach the Dark Lord's return, 
      discuss literature, etc... whatever you like. Wotlas is a free discussion/play 
      ground. Of course those of you that expected a real MUD ( Multi-User Dungeon 
      ) will be very disappointed... We will probably add fights features and 
      one power effects in a next version of wotlas but this is not our primary 
      goal.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.3</b> - I'm trying to speak to someone in the chat but he doesn't seem 
    to hear me. How does this damned chat work ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">It's important to understand that only people that are in 
      the <i>same</i> room as you can hear you ( unless you shout of course ). 
      The best way to be sure that you'll be heard is to walk near the other player. 
      If you want a detailed description of our chat features you should read 
      the in-game help ( hit the <i>Help</i> button and go to the chat section 
      ). You'll see that our chat has a lot of features !</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.4 </b> - Why are the movements on the world map so slow ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The answer is in the question ! In a future version of wotlas 
      it will be even slower ! We intend to make a travel's duration in phase 
      with reality. But of course we will never force you to wait in front of 
      your screen for the end of a long journey ! If you start a long journey 
      on the world map, quit wotlas and re-connect later you'll notice that your 
      player carried on his travel on the server-side.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.5</b> - I'm on a map where there seems to be an opening on a side, but 
    it doesn't lead me to anywhere. What's this all about ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">We let some openings on our maps to be sure we'll eventually 
      be able to add/connect more maps to them.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.6</b> - I've been wandering on a map and I don't seem to be able to 
    leave it. What's happening ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, you are not lucky it's a room link detection bug. 
      To solve your problem look at the room name where you got this bug ( it's 
      the name on the top-right of the game window ). Try to come back to this 
      room and re-try to leave it. Please contact us also to tell us on which 
      map/room you caught this bug.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.7</b> - I don't meet anybody in this game. Isn't it supposed to be an 
    online community ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Keep in mind we are all in different time zones. Also we 
      don't advertise wotlas a lot... for now the wotlas community is rather european, 
      i.e. players are connected around 20h-0h G.M.T.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.8</b> - Can my character get killed in wotlas ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, I'm sure lot of wotlas users are not aware of it, 
      but <i>yes, </i>your character can get killed in wotlas... In fact the Dark 
      One is the only character that can kill someone in the game. So if you go 
      to Shayol Ghul don't displease him ! Note also that he can only kill your 
      character ( connected or not ) if your are near his prison.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.9</b> - I see a lot of people in the game but they are transparent and 
    don't answer me. Can you explain ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">When you quit wotlas your character stays in the game. Note 
      the word <i>'away' </i>appearing near the player name when you click on 
      a player. Also the player's <i>Away Message</i> appear when he is not connected.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.10</b> - is my discussion saved when I chat with someone in wotlas ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Yes. Take a look at the content of your wotlas <i>log/ </i>directory. 
      It contains all your wotlas discussions. They are automatically saved.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.11</b> - Sometimes when I travel to a location of the game the wotlas 
    server connection seems to be shut and automatically re-started. what's happening 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">This is because of our multi-server feature. See question 
      3.12 .</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.12</b> - What's this multi-server feature all about ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Since v1.2 wotlas can share its game universe among multiple 
      servers ( the unit of share is the building ). It means for example that 
      one server will host the White Tower in Tar Valon while another server will 
      host the remaining buildings of the Tar Valon town. When travelling from 
      the White Tower to another Tar Valon building your wotlas account will be 
      automatically transfered to the other server, your connection will be closed 
      and re-opened on the new server. Of course this operation can fail if the 
      target server is not running. In this case you'll get an error message telling 
      you to retry later.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.13</b> - Can I spy chat groups ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Yes but don't get caught ! try to move near enough a chat 
      group ( humming... looking at the sky... &nbsp;) to hear what is said and 
      then don't move. Beware ! you won't hear what is whispered... A good solution 
      if you don't want to be identified too easily is to first create a fake 
      name in the lie panel... but of course it won't work if the people you are 
      trying to spy know you already !</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.14</b> - I want to become a darkfriend, what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Try to find other darkfriends or make a trip to the Blight 
      ( north of the world ). You can also visit Shayol Ghul but it can get dangerous...</font></p>

  <p><b>3.15</b> - How do I know the people I'm speaking to are darkfriends ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Well, if they are trying to convince you that the Dark One 
      can't be beaten... or that the dark side has its good aspects... If you 
      are hunting black ajah Aes Sedai, remember that a true Aes Sedai can not 
      lie...</font></p>

  <p><b>3.16</b> - I'm trying to speak to another connected player be he/she doesn't 
    react ? what's happening ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Someone may be connected to the game but doing something 
      else, not seeing that you are there. To draw attention try to enter a <i>/bell</i>, 
      <i>/fanfare</i> or <i>/knock</i> in the chat. Hope that the other player 
      has not turned off his/her PC speakers ...</font></p>

  </font><font size="3"></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>4.0 -</b> The game has crashed with a <i>'external exception occured'</i> 
    message. What happened ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, we thought we had fixed this bug... it was due to 
      a bad synchronization in our sound library. Try to turn off the music in 
      the <i>Options</i> panel. If it doesn't work please let us know.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>4.1</b> - I've checked my <i>c:\windows\tmp</i> directory and it's full 
    of <i>font*.ttf</i> files ! What's that ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">It's a Java 1.3 bug. The fonts we use are stored by Java 
      in temporary system files. The problem is, for an obscure reason, Java or 
      Windows fails to delete these temporary files... so you'll have to do it 
      yourself. Beware on Windows 2000 and XP the tmp/ directory is in your user 
      data directory, not in <i>c:\windows\tmp</i>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>4.2</b> - I'm using Java 1.4. Why can't I see my player name above my 
    character ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">We have been succesfully testing Java 1.4 with wotlas <i>but</i> 
      with some graphic cards there seems to be the following problems : the player's 
      name doesn't appear above him when you click on him, the location's name 
      doesn't appear on the top right side of the game screen. We are working 
      on these bugs.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>4.3</b> - The music volume increased suddendly. What happened ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Well we encountered a lot of problems with the javax.sound.midi 
      API 1.3 and we solved them all. If you still have music volume problems 
      please let us know. There is one last bug we didn't fixed in Java 1.3 : 
      try to produce a sound ( chat sound, door creaking, etc... ) when the current 
      music ends... you'll notice it starts again ( normal ) but with a much higher 
      volume... you'll have to leave the map to make it return to normal. With 
      Java 1.4 the problem disappears...</font></p>

  <p><b>5.0 -</b> What does the name <i>wotlas</i> mean ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font size="2">Well, that's easy. It's <b>W</b>heel <b>O</b>f <b>T</b>ime 
      - <b>L</b>ight <b>A</b>nd <b>S</b>hadow. The name <i>Light And Shadow</i> 
      was chosen after a poll among the development team.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.1</b> - What gave you the idea to start this project ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font size="2">The french <i>Wheel Of Time</i> mailing list has a founder 
      member named Val&egrave;re which wanted to create a new kind of mud/chat 
      for the mailing list members. After some brain storming on the subject a 
      development project begun in March 2001. Our goal was, at the time, to create 
      a new kind of online multiplayer game that would offer to players enhanced 
      ways to communicate and interact. We've not reach our goal yet but we are 
      getting closer each day.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.2</b> - Do you intend to continue this project ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, yes and no. We really don't know. We have a <i>Wotlas 
      Features</i> <i>To Do </i>list that could keep ourselves busy for years... 
      and we work very sporadically on the project... ( we are all working for 
      busy companies... ) We are still surprised to realize that we worked on 
      it for now more than a year... if you want to join our development team 
      you are welcome... it might maintain the project alive.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.3</b> - What are the next features that should appear in the next version 
    of wotlas ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Ah ! huge question... briefly we want to add : objects, 
      one power effects, a knowledge system, books that you'll be able to write, 
      libraries, role playing features, bots, IA bots, money, in-game post/mails, 
      more maps, more graphical effects, more characters, etc... and that's only 
      the beginning... we have a huge <i>ToDo</i> list.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.4</b> - Where can I get information on the current development of wotlas 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The main source of information on wotlas is its web site 
      : <i>wotlas.sourceforge.net. </i>For more information on what we develop 
      you can try <i>wotlas.sf.net/devel</i> but it's all in french...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.5</b> - How can I help you ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Mainly we lack of time to create new maps for the game. 
      So if you know how to use Adobe Photoshop, know the Wheel Of Time universe 
      and think you can create maps that are in the same style as ours... you're 
      welcome ! you can download our texture package in <i>wotlas.sf.net/pub. 
      </i>Please<i> </i>mail us to get more information on the map's format, scale 
      and cell units.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you are a skilled Java developer and want to work on 
      our project you are welcome too ! but know that, because we work on wotlas 
      very sporadically, you'll have to work a lot on your own. Don't worry we'll 
      still be there to answer any of your questions.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.6</b> - Are you going to use the wotlas user database for some purpose 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">No ! never ! the only things personal we might have from 
      you are your password and eventually email address. We will never give them 
      to anybody and never use them for any purpose ( apart, for the email address, 
      to contact you in case of account problems ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.7</b> - I've found a lot of english language mistakes in this FAQ. Don't 
    you read what you write ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, the writers of this FAQ are from a non english-speaking 
      country. So if you find let's say <i>typography</i> errors ;) please warn 
      us on our wotlas forum. Don't worry it won't offend us ! In fact we are 
      even used to it... ;)</font></p>
