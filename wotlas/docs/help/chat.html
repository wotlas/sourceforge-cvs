  <p>Here is how work our wotlas chat. We know there are lots of rules, so, if 
    you find some of them hard to use in the game please let us know ! Here we 
    go :</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >On building 
      maps chat channels are attached to rooms, you can only discuss with players 
      of the <b>same</b> room/place.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >You might 
      have notice that there is always a <i>default</i> chat anywhere you go. 
      This channel represents the place where you are. When you speak in this 
      <i>default</i> channel your messages are sent to everybody in the room.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >You can 
      create an other chat channel if you want to discuss in private with some 
      other players. Just hit the button representing an empty document with a 
      *.This user channel will be seen <b>only</b> by the players of your current 
      room.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >User 
      chat channels have a <b>completely different</b> behaviour from the <i>default</i> 
      chat. To join a user chat channel you have to be <b>near</b> <b>someone 
      who is using it</b>. That means that you need to move near a group of players 
      to be able to communicate on their user chat channel.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" > If you 
      <b>move toward</b> a player that has a user chat your current chat channel 
      will be automaticaly changed to his/her. </p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" > To leave 
      a user chat channel you can either hit the <i><b>Leave</b> </i>button <b>or 
      move away</b> from the players that are using the channel. When the last 
      member of a user channel moves away, the channel is automatically destroyed... 
      <b>except</b> if he/she's the creator of the chat channel. This way the 
      creator of a user channel can move with his/her channel and if he/she comes 
      near a player who is on the <i>default</i> chat, this player will have our 
      channel as the currently selected one.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >You might 
      have notice your player <b>speach volume</b> on the bottom-left of the chat. 
      There are three volume level : <i>whisper</i> (on the left), <i>normal</i> 
      (default), <i>shout</i> (on the right).</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >When 
      you shout everybody in the room <b>and in the near rooms</b> receive your 
      message on their current chat.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >When 
      you enter a new user chat channel <b>you are not</b> considered as an <i>active 
      </i> member of the user channel. It means that you'll be able to hear what's 
      said <b>but not what's whispered</b> ! To become an <i>active </i>member 
      of a user chat channel just send a message to it ! you will then hear everything, 
      even whispers.</p>
    <p><img src="file:../base/gui/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >If you 
      don't want people that moves near your group to hear what you say in your 
      user chat channel you should whisper... this way other people won't be able 
      to eavesdrop without you knowing.</p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p>/shout - to shout</p>
    <p>/whisper - to whisper</p>
    <p>/me - to begin a sentence with : <i>'[your name] says ...'</i> </p>
