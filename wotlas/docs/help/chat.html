  <p>Here is how our wotlas chat works. If you find it hard to use in the game 
    please let us know ! Here we go :</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >On building 
      maps chat channels are attached to rooms, you can only discuss with players 
      of the <b>same</b> room/place.</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >You might 
      have noticed that there is always a <i>default</i> chat channel anywhere 
      you go. This channel represents the place where you are. When you speak 
      in it your messages are sent to everybody in the room.</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >You can 
      create an other chat channel if you want to discuss in private with some 
      other players. Just click the icon representing an empty document with a 
      star. This user channel will be seen <b>only</b> by the players of your 
      current room/location.</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >User 
      chat channels have a <b>completely different</b> behaviour from the <i>default</i> 
      chat channel. To join a user chat channel you have to be <b>near</b> <b>someone 
      who is using it</b>, i.e. you need to move near a group of players to be 
      able to communicate on their chat channel. Logical isn't it ?</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" > If you 
      <b>move toward</b> a player that has a user chat channel your current chat 
      channel will change automatically to his/her. </p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" > To leave 
      a user chat channel you can either hit the <i><b>Leave</b> </i>button <b>or 
      move away</b> from the players that are using the channel. When the last 
      member of a user channel moves away, the channel is automatically destroyed... 
      <b>except</b> if he/she is the creator of the chat channel. This way the 
      creator of a user channel can move with his/her channel and if he/she comes 
      near a player who is on the <i>default</i> chat channel, this player will 
      have our channel as the currently selected one.</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >You might 
      have noticed your player <b>speech volume</b> on the bottom-left of the 
      chat. There are three volume level : <i>whisper</i> (on the left), <i>normal</i> 
      (default), <i>shout</i> (on the right).</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >When 
      you shout everybody in your room <b>and the near rooms</b> receive your 
      message on their current chat channel.</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >When 
      you enter a new user chat channel <b>you are not</b> considered as an <i>active 
      </i> member of the user channel. It means that you'll be able to hear what's 
      said <b>but not what's whispered</b> ! To become an <i>active </i>member 
      of a user chat channel just send a message to it ! you will then hear everything, 
      even whispers.</p>
    <p><img src="images/shady-pin.gif" width="14" height="14" >If you 
      don't want people that move around your group to hear what you say in your 
      user chat channel you should whisper... this way other people won't be able 
      to eavesdrop without you knowing.</p>

  <p><font size="4"><b>Chat <a name="shortcuts">Shortcuts</a> &amp; Commands</b></font></p>
  <p>You can use the following shortcuts in the chat prompt (your message must 
    begin with them):</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>/shout - to shout</p>
    <p>/whisper - to whisper</p>
    <p>/me - to begin a sentence with : <i>'[your name] says ...'</i> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We also provide some commands you can use in the chat :</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>/fanfare, /knock, /bell - produce a sound to draw attention. The fanfare 
      sound is not the same for each character class.</p>
    <p>/who - to display the list of connected players</p>
    <p>/help - to display all the available commands. You can also click on the 
      <i>chat /?</i> icon.</p>
    <p>/server - to get some information on the current server.</p>
    <p>/info - command documentation. For example to get some information on the 
      <i>/who</i> command enter <i>/info:/who</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Finally, if you enter *doh* or *toh* in a chat message it will produce the 
    famous Homer Simpson's sounds...</p>

  <p>You can use smileys in our chat : here are the ones we recognize and convert 
    into images. If you want to see the associated images open the <i>gui/chat/smileys.html</i> 
    file in an Internet browser. </p>
