  <p><b><font size="3">1.0</font></b><font size="3"> - What do I need to do to 
    host a server ?<a name="q10"></a></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You need to have a computer with a DSL Internet connection 
      or better. That's all for the hardware. If your computer has its own domain 
      name it will make things easier for you, but you can still live without 
      it ( depends on your Internet provider ). The most important thing to know 
      is that your computer will have to run 24 hours per day and 7days per week. 
      Of course you are still free to stop your server now and then or stop hosting 
      it for ever. We are not a dictatorship !<br>

  <p><b>1.1</b> - Why do I need to register my server ?<a name="q11"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">To enable other users to find it and connect to it ! This 
      way your server will be listed in our public server table. Of course you 
      can also create you own wotlas network with your own list of servers. To 
      do that download the <i>wotlas manager</i> package and follow the instructions 
      ( note it's experimental ).<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.2</b> - What is the <i>setup</i> utility for ?<a name="q12"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The <i>setup</i> utility is used to publish your server's 
      IP/DNS address on our wotlas web server. When you used the <i>register</i> 
      utility you declared and exported a server config that does <i>not</i> contain 
      your IP/DNS address. Why ? because your server's IP address can change very 
      often (if you don't have a domain name) and the <i>register</i> utility 
      is only there to declare static data. Each time your server's IP change 
      you'll have to use the <i>setup</i> utility.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="#top">back to the top</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.3</b> - My server has a fixed domain name, can I enter it in the setup 
    utility instead of the IP address ?<a name="q13"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2"> Yes. If your server has its own domain name, just call 
      the <i>setup</i> utility once, enter your DNS name, export it and quit. 
      You can now start your server and don't need to bother again about setup... 
      unless your computer's IP changes often. You can find free domain name offers 
      on the Internet but you should avoid them. To learn why, read the answer 
      to question 1.16 .<br>
      <br>
      <a href="#top">back to the top</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.4</b> - My server has no domain name and its IP is often changed by 
    my Internet provider. What can I do ?<a name="q14"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well there are no miracles. Each time your server's IP changes 
      you'll have to stop your wotlas server, use the <i>setup</i> utility to 
      update your server's IP and re-start your wotlas server. It's a matter of 
      tempo. If you know your Internet provider's habits it can help you <i>a 
      lot</i>. For example, DSL providers often reset your connection after 24 
      hours of use and change your IP every 1-4 days. Knowing that you can start 
      your Internet connection at a period of the day where you know you'll be 
      at home. This way you'll be there each time to check if the IP has changed.<br>
      <br>
      Note also if your network connection is reseted there is no need to stop 
      &amp; restart your wotlas server if your IP has not changed ( at least on 
      windows systems... we've not checked for Linux ).<br>

  <p><b>1.5</b> - How do I get my server's IP ?<a name="q15"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">On Windows systems just open a MS-DOS window or command-line 
      window and enter <i>ipconfig</i>. It'll display all your IP interfaces. 
      On unix systems enter <i>ifconfig</i> to obtain the same result. You may 
      also open this url in your web browser : <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org:8245">http://checkip.dyndns.org:8245</a><br>

  <p><b>1.6</b> - I have a DSL Internet connection that works with a DSL hub which 
    is connected to my server via an ethernet network. How can I make my server 
    be enabled from the Internet ?<a name="q16"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> 
    <p><font size="2">If your ADSL modem is directly connected to your computer 
      via a PPPoE connection please go to question <a href="#q117">1.17</a>. If 
      not you'll have to set up NAT ( Network Address Translation) entries on 
      your ADSL hub.<br>
      <br>
      You need to use NAT because you have only one public IP address, so you'll 
      have to do port translation ( for the 3 ports you declared in the <i>register.bat</i> 
      utility) to the computer where your wotlas server is running.<br>
      <br>
      For example, if your server private IP is 192.168.1.2 and the declared wotlas 
      server ports are 763, 764 and 765, then :<br>
      <br>
      1 - add the following NAT rules:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">- ADD IP NAT TCP 763 192.168.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( 
        Game server )<br>
        - ADD IP NAT TCP 764 192.168.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( 
        Account server )<br>
        - ADD IP NAT TCP 765 192.168.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( 
        Gateway server )</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">2</font><font size="2"> - Put your private server IP ( 192.168.1.2 
      here ) in the file base/servers/server-<i>N</i>.cfg.adr (where <i>N</i> 
      is your server id).<br>
      <br>
      3 - Start your server.<br>
      <br>
      4 - Publish your public ip with the <i>setup</i> utility (cf. <a href="#q12">1.2</a>).<br>
      <br>
      Each time your public ip changes, you can use the <i>setup</i> utility (cf. 
      <a href="#q12">1.2</a>) to update your server's IP <b><i>without</i></b> 
      having to restart your server (cf. <a href="#q15">1.5</a>).<br>
      <br>
      IMPORTANT : To test the wotlas client ( via the wotlas-client package ) 
      from your private network, the file base/servers/server-<i>N</i>.cfg.adr 
      must contain the private ip address of your server (not the public address!). 
      Good Luck !<br>

  <p><b>1.7</b> - How can I move my wotlas server to another computer ?<a name="q17"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The easiest way is to move the entire <i>wotlas server</i> 
      package to the other computer, re-start the <i>setup</i> utility and of 
      course <i>re-start</i> the server. If for some reason you can't tranfer 
      the entire package just move the following directories : <i>base/home</i> 
      , <i>base/servers</i>, <i>base/universe</i>,<i> base/configs .</i><br>

  <p><b>1.8</b> - I have a firewall on my computer what do I need to do ?<a name="q18"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll have to configure it to make it accept : incoming 
      connections on <i>java </i>( if you want to be precise just open the ports 
      you declared in the <i>register</i> utility ), outgoing connections on <i>java 
      </i> ( your server will probably use HTTP, your server's ports and the gateway 
      ports of other servers, so the easiest solution is to let any outgoing ports 
      available for java ).<br>

  <p><b>1.9</b> - How do I shutdown my server ?<a name="q19"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Press Enter. It will take 30s to shutdown. If nobody connected 
      to the server since the last maintenance save then you can stop it with 
      a CTRL+C. If you are not sure press ENTER.<br>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Just mail your wotlas network administrator. Attach to your 
      mail the following zipped directories of your server package : <i>base/home</i> 
      , <i>base/configs</i>. You should also delete your <i>server-X.cfg.adr</i> 
      file on the wotlas web server.<br>

  <p><b>1.11</b> - Someone mailed me to ask for a key to create a <i>special character</i> 
    ? what's this all about ?<a name="q111"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Special characters are characters that can only appear once 
      in the game. Players have to mail you to ask for the ones that are not already 
      taken. You should keep a list of the already taken special characters. The 
      keys to enable a special character are listed in the <i>base/configs/server.cfg</i> 
      . Note that these keys change each time you start your server and are changed 
      by the server every 24 hours. Therefore when you mail a key to a player, 
      the player doesn't have a lot of time to use it. Your keys should be kept 
      secret. <br>

  <p><b>1.12</b> - I want to delete someone's account. How can I do that ?<a name="q112"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll need to know the primary key ( <i>aldiss-1-1</i> 
      for example ) of the account you want to delete. Once you have it you'll 
      have to stop your server ( press Enter ), delete the directory in <i>base/home/</i> 
      which name is the primary key and re-start your server.<br>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well we have no explanation but we witnessed this problem 
      on some Windows OS. This is why we often use the reserved ports : 770, 771, 
      772. These ports are <i>quite</i> never used on the Internet.<br>

  <p><b>1.14</b> - Do I need to warn the wotlas network administrator if I have

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">If you have to stop your server for less than 12 hours there 
      should be no need to ring the wotlas network administrator. If you have

  <p><b>1.15</b> - Are there any start-up options I can use for my server ?<a name="q115"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Edit your <i>server.bat</i> or <i>server.sh</i> script. 
      At the end of the <i>ServerDirector</i> line you can add : a <i>-debug </i>if 
      you want more debug information, a <i>-erroronly</i> if you only want errors 
      to be displayed and not <i>NOTICE</i>,<i> WARNING</i> messages. There is 
      also a <i>-daemon</i> option if you want your server to send the log messages 
      directly to disk without printing them to the screen.<br>

  <p><b>1.16</b> - I've found a free domain name offer on the Internet, do you 
    advice me to use it for wotlas ?<a name="q116"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, it depends on the offer's content... know that a domain 
      name will be useful to you <i>ONLY </i> if it offers you to have a static 
      ( or quite never changing ) IP address. Well, all the offers of this kind 
      we've met so far are not free... (see your Internet Provider offers). So 
      what can you do ? well, you can still use a free domain name for your wotlas 
      server BUT you have to know the side effects. Let's take the example of 
      <i>www.dyndns.org</i> that proposes you a free <i>xxx.dyndns.org</i> domain 
      name :</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">1 - The offer consists in the association DNS entry / 
        your IP address. Therefore if your IP changes you'll have to use the <i>Dyndns</i> 
        web interface to update your IP in the dyndns DNS tables.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">2 - Of course <i>Dyndns</i> proposes client programs that 
        will detect when your IP changed and will automatically update the <i>Dyndns</i> 
        tables. But even if you can get these client programs to work, there will 
        remain a <i>huge trouble : </i>Internet uses <i>a lot</i> of DNS buffers, 
        proxies and it will take <i>around 4 hours</i> for your new IP to be spread 
        among them. So each time your IP changes your wotlas server will be unreachable 
        for about 4 hours...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">So, unless you have a domain name with its own static IP, 
      we strongly advice you to enter your IP address in the wotlas <i>setup</i> 
      utility each time you have to. It will make your server immediately available 
      to users.<br>

  <p><b>1.17</b> - My DSL modem is using PPPoE, not PPPoA. Do I have to do something

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, as long as your ADSL modem is directly connected to

      ) as with PPPoA ( PPP over ATM ), though PPPoE can be confusing.<br>

  <p><b>1.18</b> - I'm tring to use the <i>Setup</i> utility but the file tranfer 
    with <i>pscp</i> doesn't seem to be working... what's happening ?<a name="q118"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">First check that, if you have a firewall on your computer, 
      <i>pscp</i> has access to Internet. Then, if you have registered your server 
      on the wotlas public network, you'll have to make sure <i>pscp</i> knows 
      the encryption key of <i>SourceForge.net</i>. To do that open a shell/command 
      window and enter the following line :<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pscp &nbsp;&nbsp;test.txt &nbsp;&nbsp;mySourceForgeLogin@shell.sf.net:/home/groups/w/wo/wotlas/<br>
      <br>
      Once you have done that the <i>Setup </i>utility should be working perfectly. 
      For your information here is what the <i>PuTTY</i> docs says :</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PuTTY records 
        the host key for each server you connect to, in the Windows Registry. 
        Every time you connect to a server, it checks that the host key presented 
        by the server is the same host key as it was the last time you connected. 
        If it is not, you will see a warning, and you will have the chance to 
        abandon your connection before you type any private information (such 
        as a password) into it.</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">But because we are using <i>PuTTY's</i> <i>pscp</i> in batch 
      mode you won't see the warnings at all, the command will just fail.<br>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Since v1.2 wotlas can share its game universe among multiple 
      servers ( the unit of share is the building ). It means for example that 
      one server will host the White Tower in Tar Valon while another server will 
      host the remaining buildings of the Tar Valon town. When travelling from 
      the White Tower to another Tar Valon building your wotlas account will be 
      automatically transfered to the other server, your connection will be closed 
      and re-opened on the new server. Of course this operation can fail if the 
      target server is not running. In this case you'll get an error message telling

    <p><font size="2">Yes but don't get caught ! try to move near enough a chat 
      group ( humming... looking at the sky... &nbsp;) to hear what is said and 
      then don't move. Beware ! you won't hear what is whispered... A good solution 
      if you don't want to be identified too easily is to first create a fake 
      name in the lie panel... but of course it won't work if the people you are 
      trying to spy know you already !<br>

  <p><b>3.18</b> - How does this <i>Lie</i> feature works ?<a name="q318"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You can create up to 5 fake names for your player. Players 
      you encounter in the game will only know you by the name you were using 
      the first time they met you. So be aware that if you talk with a group of 
      players they might call you by the different names you used... revealing 
      your identity... or your lies.<br>

  <p><b>3.19</b> - Do other players always remember the name I used the first 
    time I met them ?<a name="q319"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">No. Each wotlas character has a limited memory. The most 
      you speak to people the better you get to know them and the longer you will 
      remember their name. Each time you travel to another place your memory of 
      them is diminished. If you make long journeys ( trips to other Towns ) you 
      will only remember the name of the people you talked to / met a lot. Once 
      a player name is forgotten the next time you'll meet him you'll get his 
      current name.<br>
      <br>
      N.B : your memory also fades with time... ( a little each three days ).<br>

  <p><b>4.0 -</b> The game has crashed with a <i>'external exception occured'</i> 
    message. What happened ?<a name="q40"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, we thought we had fixed this bug... it was due to 
      a bad synchronization in our sound library. Try to turn off the music in 
      the <i>Options</i> panel. If it doesn't work please let us know.<br>

  <p><b>4.1</b> - I've checked my <i>c:\Windows\temp</i> directory and it's full 
    of <i>font*.ttf</i> files ! What's that ?<a name="q41"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">It's a Java bug. The fonts we use are stored by Java in 
      temporary system files. The problem is, for an obscure reason, Java or Windows 
      fails to delete these temporary files... so you'll have to do it yourself. 
      Beware on Windows 2000 and XP the temp/ directory is in <i>c:\Document and 
      Settings\&lt;user-name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp\</i>, not in <i>c:\Windows\temp</i>.<br>

  <p><b>4.2</b> - The music volume increased suddendly. What happened ?<a name="q42"></a></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well we encountered a lot of problems with the javax.sound.midi 
      API 1.3 and we solved them all. If you still have music volume problems 
      please let us know. There is one last bug we didn't fixed in Java 1.3 : 
      try to produce a sound ( chat sound, door creaking, etc... ) when the current 
      music ends... you'll notice it starts again ( normal ) but with a much higher 
      volume... you'll have to leave the map to make it return to normal. With 
      Java 1.4 the problem disappears...<br>
