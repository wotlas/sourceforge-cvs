  <font size="4" color="#006699">I - FAQ - Wotlas Server</font><font size="4"><br>
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><font size="3">1.0</font></b><font size="3"> - What do I need to do to 
    host a server ?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You need to have a computer with a DSL Internet connection 
      or better. That's all for the hardware. If your computer has its own domain 
      name it will make things easier for you, but you can still live without 
      it ( depends on your Internet provider ). The most important thing to know 
      is that your computer will have to run 24 hours per day and 7days per week. 
      Of course you are free to stop your server sometimes or stop hosting it 
      for ever. We are not a dictatorship !</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.1</b> - Why do I need to register my server ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">To enable other users to find it and connect to it ! This 
      way your server will be listed in our public server table. Of course you 
      can also create you own wotlas network with your own list of servers. To 
      do that download the <i>wotlas manager</i> package and follow the instructions.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.2</b> - What is the <i>setup</i> utility for ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The <i>setup</i> utility is used to publish your server's 
      IP/DNS address on our wotlas web server. When you used the <i>register</i> 
      utility you declared and exported a server config that does <i>not</i> contain 
      your IP/DNS address. Why ? because your server's IP address can change very 
      often (if you don't have a domain name) and the <i>register</i> utility 
      is only there to declare static data. Each time your server's IP change 
      you'll have to use the <i>setup</i> utility.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.3</b> - My server has a fixed domain name, can I enter it in the setup 
    utility instead of its IP address ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2"> Yes. If your server has its own domain name, just call 
      the <i>setup</i> utility once, enter your DNS name, export it and quit. 
      You can now start your server.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.4</b> - My server has no domain name and its IP is often changed by 
    my Internet provider. What can I do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well there are no miracles. Each time your server's IP is 
      changed you'll have to stop your wotlas server, use the <i>setup</i> utility 
      to update your server's IP and re-start your wotlas server. It's a matter 
      of tempo. If you know your Internet provider's habits it can help you <i>a 
      lot</i>. For example, DSL providers often reset your connection after 24 
      hours of use and change your IP every 1-4 days. Knowing that you can start 
      your Internet connection at a period of the day where you know you'll be 
      at home. This way you'll be there to check if the IP has changed.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.5</b> - How do I get my server's IP ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">On windows systems just open a MS-DOS window or command-line 
      window and enter <i>ipconfig</i>. It'll display all your IP interfaces. 
      On unix systems enter <i>ifconfig</i> to obtain the same result.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.6</b> - I have a DSL Internet connection that works with a DSL hub which 
    is connected to my server via an ethernet network. How can I make my server 
    be enabled from the Internet ?</p>
  <p><b>1.7</b> - How can I move my wotlas server to another computer ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The easiest way is to move the entire <i>wotlas server</i> 
      package to the other computer, re-start the <i>setup</i> utility and of 
      course <i>re-start</i> the server. If for some reason you can't tranfer 
      the entire package just move the following directories : <i>base/home/</i> 
      , <i>base/servers/ </i>, <i>base/universe </i>,<i> src/config.</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.8</b> - I have a firewall on my computer what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll have to configure it to make it accept : incoming 
      connections on <i>java.exe </i>( if you want to be precise just open the 
      ports you declared in the <i>register</i> utility ), outgoing connections 
      on <i>java.exe</i> ( your server will probably use HTTP, your server's ports 
      and the gateway ports of other servers, so the best is to let any outgoing 
      ports available for java ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.9</b> - How do I shutdown my server ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Press Enter. It will take 30s for it to shutdown. If nobody 
      connected to the server since the last maintenance save then you can stop 
      it with a CTRL+C.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.10</b> - I can't host my wotlas server anymore, how do I un-register 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Just mail your wotlas network administrator. Attach to your 
      mail the following zipped directories of your server package : <i>base/home</i> 
      , <i>src/config</i>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.11</b> - Someone mailed me to ask a key to create a <i>special character</i> 
    ? what's this all about ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Special characters are characters that can only appear once 
      in the game. Players have to mail you to ask for the ones that are not already 
      taken. You should keep a list of the already taken special characters. The 
      keys to enable a special character are listed in the <i>src/config/server.cfg</i> 
      . Note that these keys change each time you start your server and are changed 
      by the server every 24 hours. Therefore when you mail a key to a player, 
      the player doesn't have a lot of time to use it. Your keys should be kept 
      secret. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.12</b> - I want to delete someone's account. How can I do that ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll need to know the primary key ( 'aldiss-1-1' for example 
      ) of the account you want to delete. Once you have it you'll have to stop 
      your server ( press Enter ), delete the directory of <i>base/home</i> which 
      name is the primary key and re-start your server.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.13</b> - I'm using ports above 1024 for my wotlas server and it seems 
    nobody can connect to my server ! what's happening ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well we have no explanation but we witnessed this problem 
      on some Windows OS. This is why we often use the reserved ports : 770, 771, 
      772. These ports are <i>quite</i> never used on the Internet.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.14</b> - Do I need to warn the wotlas network administrator if I have 
    to stop my server for some time ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">If you have to stop your server for less than 12 hours there 
      should be no need to warn the wotlas network administrator. If you have 
      to stop your server for more than 12 hours mail the administrator, he will 
      update the wotlas news to warn users.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>1.15</b> - Are there any start-up options I can use for my server ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Edit your <i>server.bat</i> or <i>server.sh</i> script. 
      At the end of the <i>ServerDirector</i> line you can add : a <i>-debug </i>if 
      you want more debug information, a <i>-erroronly</i> if you only want errors 
      to be displayed and not <i>NOTICE</i>,<i> WARNING</i> messages.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>2.0</b> - When I start wotlas, nothing happens, no windows appear. What's 
    going on ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Oups. If you have installed Java 1.3 this situation should 
      not happen... Please mail us. We also witnessed a situation where wotlas 
      makes windows crash (?). Thank god it's very rare because we have no explanation... 
      If only we could get some error messages... we tried to use tools like <i>Rational</i>'s 
      <i>Purify</i> ( thanks for the demo !), but we failed to reproduce the bug...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.1</b>- When I start wotlas, the log window appears and then nothing 
    happens. What's going on ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">It probably means that the wotlas web server is unreachable. 
      Look at what is displayed in the log window, there should be a message saying 
      <i>&quot;Wotlas Web Server Unreachable. Trying again... (1/12)&quot; . </i> 
      So wait until these tries end and you should get a message explaining the 
      situation. The message is the following : <i>&quot;We failed to contact 
      the wotlas web server. So we could not update our servers addresses. If 
      this is not the first time you start wotlas on <br>
      your computer, you can try to connect with the previous server config files. 
      Otherwise please restart wotlas later.&quot;. </i>You will get this message 
      if :</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">(1) the wotlas web server is not working. Because our 
        default web server is SourceForge.net this situation won't happen every 
        day...<br>
        (2) you are trying to use wotlas from your company. There is 99% chance 
        that your company uses a firewall or a proxy and wotlas doesn't like it 
        very much... ( prefer wotlas at home... )<br>
        (3) a strange error occured... in this case mail us ! ( take a look at 
        question 2.6 to know what to do )</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.2</b> - I have a firewall on my computer, what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">You'll have to configure it to make it accept outgoing connections 
      on <i>java.exe</i> ( your <i>wotlas-client</i> will probably use HTTP, and 
      various server ports... so the best is to let any outgoing ports available 
      for java ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.3</b> - I'm trying to start wotlas from a computer within my company 
    and it doesn't work. What's going on ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Read the answer to question 2.1 . There is 99% chance that 
      your company uses a firewall or a proxy and wotlas doesn't like it very 
      much... ( prefer wotlas at home... ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.4</b> - How do I know if my Internet connection uses a proxy ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">C</font><font size="2">heck you Internet browser's parameters. 
      For example, on Windows if you have Internet Explorer ( personal note : 
      have you tried www.opera.com ? ) find the <i>Internet Options</i> in the 
      menu and take a look at the <i>Connections</i> tab. If your HTTP port is 
      not 80 it means there is a proxy somewhere.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.5</b> - When I started wotlas I had a window telling me to choose a 
    server to create an account, but the server's list is empty ! What happened 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Are you sure you didn't get a warning message when you started 
      wotlas ? no ? well, if there wasn't any you can still read the answer to 
      question 2.1, there is 99% chance it'll represent your situation. If you 
      find an error message in a command window somewhere please contact us, you've 
      probably found a new bug...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.6</b> - The game crashed after the final step of the account creation. 
    What happened ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, this is just after this final step, when you enter 
      the game, that some conflicts can happen. Here are the conflicts we know 
      :</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="2">- Divx3.1 software. Please un-install it and install Divx4.0 
        (or more).<br>
        - Midi musics. If you're not lucky your sound card drivers might conflict 
        with the javax.sound API. On the main wotlas screen, hit the <i>Options</i> 
        button and turn off the music ( set the music volume to 0 ).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">If this didn't help to solve your problem please read the 
      answer to question 2.7 below.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.7</b> - My problem is not listed here <i>or</i> Wotlas has crashed... 
    what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">If the questions listed here didn't help you solve your 
      problem please contact us. You'll find all the addresses to contact us in 
      the <i>wotlas.html</i> file of your package's root directory. Our support 
      page is <i>http://sourceforge.net/projects/wotlas . </i>You can choose to 
      create a new bug entry or leave a message on one of our forums.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In any case, you'll have to (1) describe where and when 
      your problem occured, (2) tell us about any error messages that might have 
      been displayed in the command line window, (3) give us the content of your 
      log file : <i>log/wotlas-client.log</i> .</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2.8</b> - Are there any start-up options I can use for my wotlas client 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Edit your <i>client.bat</i> or <i>client.sh</i> script. 
      At the end of the <i>ClientDirector</i> line you can add : a <i>-debug </i>if 
      you want more debug information (beware it will really display a LOT of 
      debug messages), <i>-classic </i> if you want the classic gray log window 
      image instead of the brown one.</font></p>

  </font><font size="3"></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>3.0 -</b> I'm searching help on how to play wotlas, where can I find it 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, you will find some help here but you will also get 
      some in the game : just hit the <i>Help</i> button ! The in-game help has 
      some sections that explain how the chat works, how the movement system works, 
      etc... </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.1</b> - Can I create more than one game account ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, of course ! There is no particular upper limit. You 
      can also delete old characters you don't want to use anymore.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.2</b> - Ok I'm in the game. What can I do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Wotlas is a virtual community so the main things you'll 
      do here are : travel, chat with other players, build plots, make up stories, 
      search darkfriends, preach to Dark Lord's return, discuss literature, etc... 
      whatever you like. Wotlas is a free discussion/play ground. Of course those 
      of you that expected a real MUD ( Multi-User Dungeon ) will be very disappointed... 
      We will probably add fights features and one power effects in a next version 
      of wotlas but this is not our primary goal.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.3</b> - I'm trying to speak to someone in the chat but he doesn't seem 
    to hear me. How does this damned chat works?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">It's important to understand that only people that are in 
      the <i>same</i> room as you can hear you ( unless you shout of course ). 
      The best way to be sure that you'll be heard is to walk near the other player. 
      If you want a detailed description of our chat features you should read 
      the in-game help ( hit the <i>Help</i> button and go to the chat section 
      ). You'll see that our chat has a lot of features !</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.4 </b> - Why are the movements on the world map so slow ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The answer is in the question ! In a future version of wotlas 
      it will be even slower ! We intend to make movements in phase with reality. 
      But of course we will never force you to wait for the end of a long trip 
      ! If you start a long travel on the world map, quit wotlas and re-connect 
      later you'll notice that your player continued his/her travel on the server-side.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.5</b> - I'm on a map where there seems to be an opening on a side, but 
    it doesn't lead me to anywhere. What's this all about ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">We let some openings on maps to be sure we'll eventually 
      be able to add/connect more maps.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.6</b> - I've been wandering on a map and I don't seem to be able to 
    leave it. What's happening ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, you are not lucky it's a room link detection bug. 
      To solve your problem look at the room name where you got this bug ( it's 
      the name on the top-right of the game window ). Try to come back to this 
      room and re-try to leave it. Please also contact us to tell us on which 
      map/room you got this bug.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.7</b> - I don't meet anybody in that game. Isn't it supposed to be an 
    online community ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Keep in mind we are all in different time zones. Also we 
      don't advertise wotlas a lot... for now the wotlas community is rather european, 
      i.e. players are connected around 20h-0h G.M.T.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.8</b> - Can my character get killed in wotlas ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, I'm sure lot of wotlas users are not aware of it, 
      but <i>yes, </i>your character can get killed in wotlas... In fact the Dark 
      One is the only character that can kill someone in the game. So if you go 
      to Shayol Ghul to visit him don't displease him ! Note also that he can 
      only kill your character ( connected or not ) if your are near his prison.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.9</b> - I see a lot of people in the game but they are transparent and 
    don't answer me. Can you explain ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">When you quit wotlas your character stays in the game. Note 
      the word <i>'away' </i>appearing near the player name when you click on 
      a player. Also the player's <i>Away Message</i> appear when he is not connected.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.10</b> - When I chat with someone in wotlas, is our discussion saved 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Yes. Take a look at the content of your wotlas <i>log/ </i>directory. 
      It contains all your wotlas discussions. They are automatically saved.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.11</b> - Sometime when I travel to a location of the game the wotlas 
    server connection seems to be shut and automatically re-started. what's happening 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">This is because of the wotlas multi-server feature. See 
      question 3.12 .</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.12</b> - What's this multi-server feature all about ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Since v1.2 wotlas can share its game universe between multiple 
      servers ( the unit of share is the building ). It means for example that 
      one server will host the White Tower in Tar Valon while another server will 
      host the remaining buildings of the Tar Valon town. When travelling from 
      the White Tower to another Tar Valon building your wotlas account will be 
      automatically transfered to the other server, your connection will be closed 
      and re-opened on the new server. Of course this operation can fail if the 
      target server is not running. In this case you'll get an error message telling 
      you to retry later.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.13</b> - Can I spy chat groups ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Yes but don't get caught ! try to move near enough a chat 
      group ( humming... looking at the sky... &nbsp;) to hear what is said and 
      then don't move. Beware you won't hear what is whispered... A good solution 
      if you don't want to be identified too easily is to first create a fake 
      name in the lie panel... but of course it won't work if the people you are 
      trying to spy know you already !</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.14</b> - I want to become a darkfriend, what do I need to do ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Try to find other darkfriends or make a trip to the Blight 
      ( north of the world ). You can also visit Shayol Ghul but it can be dangerous...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.15</b> - How do I know the people I'm speaking to are darkfriends ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Well, if they try to convince you that the Dark One can't 
      be beaten... or that the dark side has its good aspects... If you are hunting 
      Black Ajah Aes Sedai remember that an Aes Sedai can not lie...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.16</b> - I'm trying to speak to another connected player be he/she doesn't 
    react ? what's happening ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Someone may be connected to the game but doing something 
      else, not seeing that you are there. To draw attention try to enter a <i>/bell</i>, 
      <i>/fanfare</i> or <i>/knock</i> in the chat. All you have to hope is that 
      the other player has not turned off his/her PC speakers ...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>3.17</b> - Can I use wotlas for meetings on other subjects than the Wheel 
    Of Time ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Yep sure. It's free, you can use wotlas for any kind of 
      meeting you want...</font></p>

  <p><b>5.1</b> - What gave you the idea to start this project ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font size="2">The french <i>Wheel Of Time</i> mailing list has a founder 
      member named Val&egrave;re which wanted to create a new kind of mud/chat 
      for the mailing list members. After some brain storming on the subject a 
      development project begun in March 2001. Our goal was, at the time, to create 
      a new kind of online multiplayer game that would offer players enhanced 
      ways to communicate and interact. We've not reach our goal yet but we are 
      getting closer each day.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.2</b> - Do you intend to continue this project ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, yes and no. We really don't know. We have a <i>Wotlas 
      Features</i> <i>To Do </i>list that could keep ourselves busy for years... 
      and we work very sporadically on the project... ( we are all working for 
      busy companies... ) We are still surprised that we worked on it for now 
      more than a year... if you want to participate in the development you are 
      welcome... it might maintain the project alive.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.3</b> - What are the next features that should appear in the next version 
    of wotlas ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Ah ! huge question... briefly we want to add : objects, 
      one power effects, a knowledge system, books that you'll be able to write, 
      role playing features, fight features, bots, money, in-game post, more maps, 
      more graphical effects, more characters, etc... and that's only the beginning... 
      we have a huge <i>ToDo</i> list.</font></p>

  <p><b>5.4</b> - Where can I get information on the current development of wotlas 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">The main source of information on wotlas is our web site 
      : <i>wotlas.sourceforge.net. </i>For more information on what we develop 
      you can try <i>wotlas.sf.net/devel</i> but it's all in french...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.5</b> - How can I help you ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Mainly we lack of time to create new maps for the game. 
      So if you know how to use Adobe Photoshop, know the Wheel Of Time universe 
      and think you can create maps that are in the same style as ours... well 
      you're welcome ! you can download our texture package in <i>wotlas.sf.net/pub. 
      </i>Please<i> </i>mail us to get more information on the map's format, scale 
      and cell units.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you are a skilled Java developer and want to work on 
      our project you are welcome too ! but know that because we work on wotlas 
      very sporadically you'll have to work a lot on your own. Don't worry we'll 
      still be there to answer any of your questions.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.6</b> - Are you going to use the wotlas user database for some purpose 
    ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">No ! never ! the only things personal we might have from 
      you are your password and eventually email address. We will never give them 
      to anybody and never use them for any purpose ( apart, for the email address, 
      to contact you in case of account problems ).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>5.7</b> - I've found a lot of english language mistakes. Don't you read 
    what you write ?</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2">Well, the writers of this FAQ are from a non english-speaking 
      country. So if you find let's say <i>typography</i> errors ;) please warn 
      us on our wotlas forum. Don't worry it won't offend us ! In fact we are 
      even used to it... ;)</font></p>
